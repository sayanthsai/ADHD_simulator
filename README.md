# ADHD_simulator
A simple ADHD focus simulator built with Python and pygame. Users complete small tasks while visual and audio distractions occur in the background. Created with minimal coding knowledge, this project aims to raise awareness and invites others to improve and expand it.

# ADHD Focus Simulator Project Document

## Overview

This project is a simple ADHD focus simulation tool built using **Python** and the **pygame** library. It is not a large or professionally engineered software product. Instead, it began as a **learning-focused experiment**, created with minimal programming background. The purpose of this tool is to simulate how distractions can affect focus and task completion, offering a basic demonstration of the challenges individuals with ADHD may experience.

The project encourages others to **build on top of this foundation**. There is significant opportunity to improve the user interface, refine task flow, enhance accessibility, and create a more polished overall experience.

## How It Works

When the simulation begins, the user is guided through a sequence of simple tasks such as clicking a button a certain number of times, typing a given word, arranging items in order, or recalling a short pattern. These tasks on their own are easy and require only basic focus.

However, while the user is completing these tasks, the program introduces controlled distractions:

Visual distractions: small shapes or text float or move across the screen.

Audio distractions: soft background sounds play at random intervals.

These distractions are intentionally subtle, not overwhelming. Their goal is to gently interrupt the user’s attention, requiring them to refocus repeatedly.

By experiencing this shift in attention during basic tasks, the user gets a small, relatable insight into how everyday activities can feel more challenging for individuals with ADHD—where attention must constantly be redirected and maintained.

The simulation continues task-by-task until all steps are completed, after which the user is encouraged to reflect on how their focus changed throughout the experience.


## Purpose of the Project

* To provide an interactive demonstration of attention challenges.
* To help people better understand how distractions can impact task focus.
* To serve as a **starting point for future development**, experimentation, and learning.

This project is **not** meant to be clinically accurate or a diagnostic tool.

## Technologies Used

| Component | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python    | Primary programming language                            |
| pygame    | Used for UI drawing, event handling, and audio playback |
| Threading | Used to play distraction sounds independently           |

The codebase is small and intentionally kept simple to be accessible to beginners.

## Features

* A sequence of simple focus-based tasks (typing, clicking, remembering patterns).
* Background narration explaining tasks.
* Soft visual distractions to simulate attention shift.
* Low-volume audio distractions playing intermittently.

These features work together to simulate a light distraction environment.

---

## Project Limitations

Because this project was built with minimal experience:

* The UI is basic and not user-optimized.
* Visual distractions are simple and can be improved.
* Task flow is linear and could be more dynamic.
* Error handling and accessibility features are limited.

These limitations are intentional to allow others to extend the project.

## Opportunities for Improvement

This project is ideal for contributors who want to:

* Redesign the UI for better clarity and usability.
* Add more varied and smarter task types.
* Improve performance and smoothness of animations.
* Create more polished soundscapes and narration timing.
* Expand accessibility for broader user groups.

Developers with experience in:

* UX design
* Cognitive experience simulation
* Human-computer interaction
* Digital accessibility

...could significantly improve this simulator.
